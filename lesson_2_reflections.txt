What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
Git initialises an empty repository data structure (a hidden .Git folder)  which is used to store extra data related to commits.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository?
What value do you think it offers?
Staging area offers an area where you can collect a subset of files which contain files whitch relate to the next commit you want to make. You can seperate out which files you want to update. The working directory can be a different version or contain other edited files not to be included in the next commit. It offers the advantage of easier management of multiple files in commits.

change?
