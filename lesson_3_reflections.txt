When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

 - if project has multiple contributors
 - if project is to be shared
 - if part of established process for individual or company (Management)
 - as a backup
 - to encourage others to contribute or provide feedback
 - if your local environment isn't suitable for retaining content. e.g. travel
 - if security is required
 - if additional resources/capacity/functionality is required


Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

 - remote may be under control of a different entity (Company/Individual/Group)
 - any changes made by other contributiors do not interfere with your branch
 - something may go wrong or unexpected results may occur
 - to use remote as a backup
 - to keep remote clean and allow you to experiement more locally and discard
 - may not have access to network/remote temporarily
